# Web-Dev-Capstone-Assignment

## Description
This project is a simple JavaScript quiz game that executes entirely within the browser console. It was created as part of the Web Dev I Lab Assignment 4. The objective is to reinforce the use of JavaScript arrays, loops, conditionals, functions, and basic input/output methods without utilizing HTML DOM manipulation.

## Features
* **Question Bank:** Stores 5 predefined questions and answers in an array of objects.
* **Interactive Input:** Uses `prompt()` to collect user answers and `alert()` to provide immediate feedback.
* **Input Validation:** Processes user input using `toLowerCase()` and `trim()` to ensure case-insensitive and whitespace-tolerant comparisons.
* **Score Tracking:** Maintains a running score throughout the quiz and displays the final result upon completion.
* **Modular Code:** Logic is encapsulated within a `runQuiz()` function for better organization.

## File Structure
* `index.html`: A basic HTML file to load the script.
* `quiz.js`: The main logic file containing the `quizQuestions` array and the `runQuiz()` function.
* `README.md`: Project documentation.

## How to Run
1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  **Open in Browser:**
    Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser. The quiz should start automatically (or check your browser's console if configured differently).
3.  **Run via Console (Alternative):**
    You can also open your browser's Developer Tools (F12), navigate to the **Console** tab, paste the code from `quiz.js`, and press **Enter** to start the quiz manually.

## Example Usage
* The game will ask: *"What is the capital of Morocco?"*
* If you type: *"  rabat  "*
* The game validates the input (trimming spaces and converting to lowercase) and alerts: *"Correct Answer"*.
* If incorrect, it alerts the correct answer.
* At the end, it displays: *"Quiz Over! Your final score is X out of 5"*.
